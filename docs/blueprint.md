# **App Name**: BS Scholars Attendance Tracker

## Core Features:

- Scholar Login/Logout: Scholars can log in and log out, selecting their school (STI, SDC, SEC, SNSU, SPUS, SJTIT, or NEMCO), name/scholar code, and event.
- Return of Service Hour Calculation: The system calculates accumulated return of service hours for each scholar.
- Scholar Profile Management: Admins can add, edit, and delete scholar profiles, including school assignment, name, and scholar code (manual input or auto-generated based on school, year, and order).
- Event Management: Admins can manage events by adding, editing, and deleting event details such as name, date, duration, and return of service hours. The system is aware that scholars get minimum hours upon login and full hours upon logout. Includes calendar-based UI for easy event navigation.
- Accumulated Hours View: Both admins and scholars can view accumulated service hours.
